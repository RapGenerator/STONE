Makaveli in this, Killuminati, all through your body
The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty, feel me
And God said, "He should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me, eat my flesh, flesh and my flesh"
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die?
I ain't a killer but don't push me, revenge is like the sweetest joy
Next to gettin' pussy, picture paragraphs unloaded
Wise words bein' quoted, peeped the weakness in the rap game
And sewed it, bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listenin'
Seein' niggaz comin' for me, to my diamonds, when they glistenin'
Now pay attention, rest in peace father, I'm a ghost in these killin' fields
Hail Mary, catch me if I go, let's go deep inside the solitary mind
Of a madman who screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies
See me flee, activate my hate, let it break, to the flame, set trip
Empty out my clip, never stop to aim, some say, "The game is all corrupted", fucked in this shit, stuck, niggaz is lucky
If we bust out this shit, plus mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die?
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die?
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makes
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin'
Instutionalized, I lived my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me father please, 'cause I'm fallin'
In the liquor store, that's the hennessee I hear ya callin'
Can I get some more? Hail til I reach hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nuttin' to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin' life as thugs
To my homeboys in Quentin Max, doin' they bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary, nigga
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die?
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die?
They got a APB, out on my thug family since the Outlawz
Run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off hennessee and Thai
Tryin' it, mixed it, now I'm twisted blisted and high
Visions of me, Thug livin' gettin' me by forever live
And I multiply survived by thugs, when I die they won't cry
Unless they comin' with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashin' in a black Ac Integ-ra
Cock back, sixty seconds til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church, I gave you love now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work and I ain't the nigga to put you on
'Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks Outlawz on a paper chase
Can you relate to this shit? I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks, Outlawz on a paper chase
Can you relate to this shit I don't got, be the shit, I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die?
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die?
We've been traveling on this wavy road long time
Til I be take off this load but we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary, we won't worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree, we won't worry everything will come real
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree we runni' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty, Hail Mary, Hail Mary
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die?
Westside, Outlawz, Makaveli the Don, Solo, Killuminati, The 7 Days
