[chorus]
i’m in black benz
i’m on the road with my girlfriend
we’ll be arrived at the song end
tonight we play till the world ends
before the world ends
carry all your friends
before the night ends
carry your girlfriend
before the night ends
drinking in white benz
singing in black benz
we on the island
go to the world end

[verse]
i need a boat
to stay with my girlfriend
she won’t do hurt
she so fantasy
i should keep her distance
you make me insane
you are so different
you make me different
we’ve on drinking
singing and dancing
swervin’ and swervin’
no one can hurt me
and no one can judge me
late night the party
we’ve been on party
i feel like homeless
heartbreak no heartbreak
throw up the money
i don’t want go sleep
i keep on swimming
i don’t want falling in love, it no good for me
i know the feeling you love me then leave me
late night the party
late night the party
everything going
everything going
late night the party
no more the party
late night the party
no more the party
 
[chorus]
i’m in black benz
i’m on the road with my girlfriend
we’ll be arrived at the song end

before the world ends
carry all your friends
before the night ends
carry your girlfriend
before the night ends
drinking in white benz
singing in black benz
we on the island
go to the world end
