[intro]
Would you die with me
Baby I’m not sure 
She said she love me 
Should I believe her
I don’t feel like this
Baby do your word
I can’t feel my face 
Baby do your worst

[chorus]
Would you die with me
Baby I’m not sure 
She said she love me 
Should I believe her
I don’t feel like this
Baby do your word
I can’t feel my face 
Baby do your worst
Would you die with me
hesitation
Can you feel my sorrow 
it won’t help me better
why u did all this

hearteater

[verse 1]
New dress on me, I feel I get everything 
Put you on my heart, you can feel all of it 
You are in my heart, do love with no limit 
Make love with me, make love with no limit 
Why you bring me down, i should have known all of it 
Why you break my heart, I can’t afford all of it 
Hide all my pain, you won’t do hurt to me
I’m tired of it, I want a new pretty girl
yeah i don’t know that girl
lying on my bed like a rose
i don’t know whether she like me or gold
for one night, i don’t want get close

[chorus]
Would you die with me
Baby I’m not sure 
She said she love me 
Should I believe her
I don’t feel like this
Baby do your word
I can’t feel my face 
Baby do your worst
Would you die with me
hesitation
Can you feel my sorrow 
it won’t help me better
why u did all this

[verse 2]
i don’t have no friends, i don’t feel OK
everybody got the same, i don’t feel OK
i’m deep in your world, i don’t feel OK
always leave me cold, i don’t feel OK
make a money dancing, make a rollie dancing on me
i don’t chase a girl, i don’t follow girls, sorry
if she call my phone, i gotta dead her, reckless
does she want me back? want my money back, that’s it
i don’t know that girl why she did all this
i don’t know that girl why she did all this for me
why u come for me when u are lonely
why u come for me when i count my money
put me on the light, put me on high light
your voice in my mind, your voice in my mind
your voice in my mind
your voice in my mind
