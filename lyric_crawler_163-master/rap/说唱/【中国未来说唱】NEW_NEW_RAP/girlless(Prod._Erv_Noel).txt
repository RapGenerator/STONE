[chorus]
baby i don’t hurt
i don’t make excuse
fall in love with cheater
i know it hurt
put ring on your finger
we should go far
money wasn’t a helper  
it didn’t work
baby i don’t do hurt
have no excuse
why u want to leave me
i get confused
i’m not so friendly
now it’s my turn
i found i was silly to keep your first

[verse 1]
keep your first
keep your first
i found i was silly to keep your first
baby i do my words
have no excuse
baby never try me 
u get me on nerve
in my opinion, you get what i need
thinking i worthless, now you regret it
you used to love me, i make u mad now
we get our plan out
you get a new man now
no one will like that sh1t
i don’t like that sh1t
i will stack my red then you want be friend
i got money on my mind
i got money on my mind

[bridge]
they are the same 
they are the same 
they are the same 
hard to pretend
i don’t regret
never in my way

[chorus]
baby i don’t hurt
i don’t make excuse
fall in love with cheater
i know it hurt
put ring on your finger
we should go far
money wasn’t a helper  
it didn’t work
baby i don’t do hurt
have no excuse
why u want to leave me
i get confused

[verse 2]
girl i’m ready to take u with me
i don’t want repeat, just go with me
you are the only that i wanna miss
no one replace, sign a release
girl are u playing with me
that’s not funny
i get hurt every time when u diss me
when i lost you, i don’t feel sorry
it doesn't matter
make me girlless
put up in the drop
i don’t want that girl in
you know i far from perfect
i don’t want be perfect
all girl make me nervous
i don’t need a girlfriend
living in my palace
no girl in my palace

[bridge]
they are the same
