[intro]
no one can hurt me
u can not hurt me
ex-girlfriend calling
she want to hurt me
but she can not hurt me
i’m not so worried
keeping on flexing
make all girl screaming

[chorus]
no one can hurt me
u can not hurt me
ex-girlfriend calling
she want to hurt me
but she can not hurt me
i’m not so worried
keeping on flexing
make all girl screaming
i’m not so lucky
she did her worst
i didn’t get her support
all she did was to urge me
why u want irk me
always play with me
leave me alone
heart break in pieces 

[verse]
i lock my phone
i won’t get message
i didn’t show up
when she said need me
so i won’t get hurt
i’m so selfish
i breaking the laws
living like savage
i did it on my own
would you see that
are u with me
i can’t afford that
i would rather die
i can’t feel it
my heart bleeding
like the rainy

[chorus]
no one can hurt me
u can not hurt me
ex-girlfriend calling
she want to hurt me
but she can not hurt me
i’m not so worried
keeping on flexing
make all girl screaming
i’m not so lucky
she did her worst
i didn’t get her support
all she did was to urge me
why u want irk me
always play with me
leave me alone
heart break in pieces
