[chorus]
evil girl 
try to in my evil life
she get to learn
how to in a evil style
insecure
do me with hell fly
let it burned
never make a devil cry
she will never see me i’m in the dark night
i do really know her through her eye
evil girl 
try to in my evil life
she get to learn
how to in a evil style

[verse]
cause i know these girls ain’t loyal
they seem to be loyal
i know these girls ain’t loyal
why they always in mind
cause i know they ain’t loyal
i know they ain’t loyal
i know they ain’t loyal
i know they ain’t loyal

[bridge]
try to break me down 
they try to break me down
heartbreaker
evil girl 
evil girl 

[chorus]
evil girl 
try to in my evil life
she get to learn
how to in a evil style
insecure
do me with hell fly
let it burned
never make a devil cry
she will never see me i’m in the dark night
i do really know her through her eye
evil girl 
try to in my evil life
she get to learn
how to in a evil style
