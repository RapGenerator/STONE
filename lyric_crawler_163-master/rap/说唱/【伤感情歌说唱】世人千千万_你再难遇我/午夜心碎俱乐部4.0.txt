是吗？
我像泡在鱼缸里
吐息着每一颗气泡
都写着我他玛在想你
Shut our my eye
See the sunshin
印着Sky
Thats黄色的海
Ma face ma mind
It was printed"I'm find."
It was printed"I'm fly."
It was printed"I'm Dead."
你曾说过 你最近过的还算ok
你曾说过 你最近过的还算ok

风铃的清脆
乱想想到黄昏过
掺和了心灰意冷
空调下的庇护所
已忘记疲惫
思考你问什么是温柔
那向日的葵
有没有向月的那种

我整整想了一晚
世界奇妙的谜团
点开百度的导航
好奇得翻出了墙
我往里搜
接着往外搜
心情接着变得紧张
宝箱里写着答案 

I can't face that pain
I can't take our dream
Can't be sleeping
I can't face that pain
I can't take our dream
Can't be sleeping
I can't face that pain
I can't take our dream
Can't be sleeping
I can't face that pain
I can't take our dream
Can't be sleeping

是吗？
我像泡在鱼缸里
吐息着每一颗气泡
都写着我他玛在想你
