[00:10.51]today i wanna restore the impression you have on my country, China,
[00:13.89]which have been exactly fabricated by media for a long time
[00:17.53]As an individual citizen based in south west of the country,
[00:21.00]i wanna speak it then
[00:22.63]You guys can know better about what the truth is and
[00:24.93]how Chinese people assess their own country
[00:26.89]and how much we don’t wanna be disputants
[00:28.55]First things first, we all know that China is a developing country
[00:31.79]it has large population and it is really hard to manage
[00:34.31]especially after world war 2, almost perished
[00:36.92]i mean what i say is true, war is always scary
[00:39.59]it is real that the pollution is severe at the present stage
[00:42.27]in big cities like Beijing, Tianjin
[00:44.13]Always pollution haze
[00:45.18]Similar to 1950s, London and LA
[00:47.70]It’s painful with higher growth rate, you see?
[00:49.87]People are too busy with business
[00:51.27]everybody wanna have a better life
[00:53.09]Make money, get married
[00:54.49]But they are like the first or sec. generation of rich

[01:19.60]The beautiful land with rich culture remain
[01:22.10]At the second verse
[01:23.11]It's really painful to point out the problems as they are too much for us to even think about and mention
[01:27.87]The food & drug security event
[01:28.99]Melamine Milk had affected 40 thousand babies and they all suffered from malnutrition
[01:32.87]What's more, there was the Vaccination issue.
[01:35.09]Illegal business operation has caused expiration and led to The panic in domestic
[01:39.70]What's wrong with the businessmen
[01:41.00]and it's reasonless to do business riding on them babies
[01:43.57]the question is there were still somebody who wanted the situation to be worse

[01:54.45]Also it is shameful to talk about some politicians
[01:57.02]because of their corruption and malversation in bidding sessions
[01:59.25]Their sexual pics and the prostitution scandals
[02:01.83]are all as a disgrace to the country and its people
[02:04.86]You are prolly also confused about the situation of Taiwan
[02:07.69]as you don't know the relationships between it and mainland
[02:10.18]Actually, for normal citizens, we just want us to be united as one
[02:12.85]cuz we think we are from one family, the same.
[02:17.60]This is China

[02:57.89]Meanwhile, we can trust the public security
[02:59.86]cuz the policemen are kind to citizens but crucial to our enemies
[03:03.15]We have tight gun control laws and we don't fear gun slaughtering
[03:06.18]cuz only cops and soldiers are able to touch it
[03:08.56]As for scientific achievement, we have Tu Youyou who discovered astemisinin.
