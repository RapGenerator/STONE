[00:13.500]I bow down and humbly bow down to the true you.
[00:20.100]The true you that's inside this body.
[00:22.300]The true essence of your atman, your true self.
[00:26.300]I bow down and I honor that.
[00:29.300]And as I look at you,
[00:32.500]I see that true you through your eyes into your soul
[00:37.100]and I let you see me.
[00:41.800]It's Namaste.
