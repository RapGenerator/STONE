[02:29.74]When every hour could be the last
[02:33.77]Why would we wait
[02:35.65]Why would we wait
[02:37.22]And every road could be unsafe
[02:40.95]But we'll be okay
[02:42.56]We'll make it
[02:44.31]We'll make it
[02:46.65]It's just who we are
[02:48.55]Say where to go
[02:50.32]And I know that I won't slow down
[02:54.06]It's just who we are
[02:55.91]And we will do anything we dream about
[03:00.29]How about now?
[03:03.82]How about now?
[03:07.52]How about now?
[03:11.25]How about now?
