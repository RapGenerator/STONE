Would you come and swoop me
I'm in your city
Would you come and swoop me
I'm in your city
B-legit:
Get's my freak on...
I get my sneak on
Hop in the brome
Call baby on the cellular
Wassup i'm in your area
And is it cool tonight for you to like get away
Meet me down at the parking lot at safeway
But not alone
You might want to bring your friends
But make sho' you and her don't forget your ends
I can't wait to see the tatoo of your kitten
It's me and 'vitti in the night we city 2 city
Levitti:
I'm in your city
Would you come and swoop me
B-legit:
We checked in in the suite up in hollywood
And the bubble bath did your playa patna good
She brought lingerie, pumps, and body oil
Scented candles and rubbed on my love handles
I'm only in for one night
My flight'll be out in the morning
I better get it before i start snoring
She was already up on top
Goin' buck for the whip cream, cherries and nuts
Levitti:
That's why little sister loved to give it up
Two in the morning i was all in her
You know i had to be the creeper
She kept jockin i have the fever
I'm in your city
Would you come and swoop me
B-legit:
Five in the mornin' hit me with the wakeup call
Whole room smellin' just like alcohol
I had a ball
But now i gotta giddi y'all
I gotta a show in pine bluff arkansas
And i must say the stay was all gravy
And keep it like that 'till i get back baby
And maybe next time we can take it to the 'nitti
It's me and 'vitti in the night we city 2 city
Levitti:
I'm in your city
Would you come and swoop me
B-legit:
Yeah its like uh...me and my cousins hit the airport you know. just touched down tryin to get something
Crackin' you know. check into this motel doin' what we do
