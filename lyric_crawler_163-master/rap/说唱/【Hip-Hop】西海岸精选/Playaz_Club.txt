[00:00.00]"Playaz Club"
[00:08.35]Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
[00:11.92]Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
[00:14.57]Check the pool or kick it in the tub
[00:16.63]Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
[00:19.29]I got a ho named Reel-to-Reel
[00:21.30]She got a buddy named SP 12, now you know the deal
[00:24.01]We gets freaky in the studio late night
[00:26.52]That's why the beats that you hear are coming real tight
[00:28.73]Something to roll to, something to stroll to
[00:31.24]If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
[00:33.59]Mo money, mo money for the bank roll
[00:35.81]Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
[00:38.32]A lot of fools put salt in the game
[00:40.63]To where these women get the notion that they running the game huh
[00:42.89]I run my own and I'm my own self person
[00:45.26]No respect make the situation worsen
[00:47.87]Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
[00:50.15]There's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
[00:52.87]Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
[00:55.28]A different part of town a different kind of freak
[00:57.54]I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
[00:59.81]And press play on the remote at the playaz club
[01:02.46]Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
[01:04.57]Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
[01:07.17]Check the pool or kick it in the tub
[01:09.15]Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
[01:12.15](more champagne, Mr. Forte?)
[01:14.92]From day one I had to get my money right
[01:16.52]Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
[01:18.99]They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
[01:21.64]We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
[01:24.05]A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
[01:26.46]Took a flight back to the Golden State and
[01:28.97]Shops made orders from a whole new capital
[01:30.92]The word was gettin' out 4-Tay's out rappable
[01:33.23]Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
[01:35.79]Suckas try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
[01:38.54]Cause the chase is on because it don't stop
[01:40.75]I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
[01:43.25]So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
[01:46.22]By the way just in case you never heard
[01:48.08]Rappin 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
[01:49.93]Never trippin' off them suckas popping off at the lip
[01:52.39]I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
[01:54.80]Leave the Gat at the house bring some dominoes
[01:57.60]Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
[01:59.91]And shoot your macking at these women at the playaz club
[02:02.32]Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
[02:04.52]Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
[02:07.09]Check the pool or kick it in the tub
[02:09.29]Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
[02:11.90]You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
[02:14.05]V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
[02:16.47]Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
[02:19.76]Now homie what you all about?
[02:21.27]I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
[02:23.93]Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
[02:26.19]You can learn a whole lot from a playa
[02:28.44]A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
[02:31.00]A lot of people get a misconception
[02:32.86]And start drifting in the wrong direction
[02:35.62]Miss goody two shoe I' see you later
[02:38.21]I ain't got time you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
[02:40.46]I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
[02:42.67]They chop game like we do in California
[02:45.18]Another show another flow a new bank account
[02:47.75]But cash money comes in large amounts
[02:50.10]So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
[02:52.61]Or else Fly will have to tap that ass
[02:54.62]And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
[02:57.27]It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club
[03:00.28]Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
[03:02.23]Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
[03:04.59]Check the pool or kick it in the tub
