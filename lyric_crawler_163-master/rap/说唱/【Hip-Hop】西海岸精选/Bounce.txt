Chorus:
I Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bou-Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
I Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bou-Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bounce
Straight From The Golden State
And So They Hate
Bou-Bounce
Straight From The Golden State
And So They Hate
Verse 1:
I Been Trapped Since Birth
Feeling Like I Been Cursed
Feeling Like
Can My Situation Get Worse?
Insane
Loco All Up In The Brain
A Lil Youngster On The Calles
Only Known To Bang
Full Of Pride
Rollin With That Southern Side
The Homie Trigger Use To Bang
Until His Brother Died
I Use To Wonder Why
Did They Take His Life
Never Felt Pain
Till I Seen His Mother Cry
And On The Other Side
Another Mother Shedding Tears
Don't Cry For Me Mama
I Ain't Happy Here
At Least That’s What His Spirit Say
Just Another Gang Retaliation
Homicide In L.A.
At Least That’s What The News Reported
But Half The Time
You Cant Trust The News
They Got It All Distorted
Its Dedicated To The Homies In The ground
Honestly I Just Thank God
That I'm Still Here
To Make Em Bounce
Chorus:
I Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bou-Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
I Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bou-Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bounce
Straight From The Golden State
And So They Hate
Bou-Bounce
Straight From The Golden State
And So They Hate
Verse 2:
So Tell Was I?..
Really Wrong
For Representin In My Songs
Court Cases Since A Child
Where Did I Go Wrong?
Most Of My Childhood Memories
Filled With Pain
Pops Gone - Mom Working
All Exposed To Bang
And All My Neighborhood Role Models
Were Packin Straps
Smokin, Slangin' Dope
Sippin' 40 Bottles
Wonder Really If I'd See Tomorrow
That’s The Method When You Banged Out
Dippin In The Monte Carlo
Some Came Up In The Dope Game
For Quick Cash
He Use To Pray Every Night
Knew It Wouldn't Last
His Life Was Gone In A Quick Flash
Now Just A Memory To The World
For Trying To Get Cash
But You Really Can't Blame Em Though
He Was Just Tryin To Provide For His Family
In A Shady World
Sometimes I Feel
I Hear His Spirit In The Clouds
Honestly I Just Thank God
That I'm Still Here
To Make Em Bounce
Chorus:
I Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bou-Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
I Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bou-Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bounce
Straight From The Golden State
And So They Hate
Bou-Bounce
Straight From The Golden State
And So They Hate
Verse 3:
Some Of The Homies Got Caught Up
In That Drug Life
Like Pac Said It
We All Live That Thug Life
I Remember The Homie Bonky
Break Down & Cry
Cause His Brother Negro
Got Hooked On The First Try
Caught Em Red Handed
With The Needle In His Vein
How Can I Stop My Brother Criminal?
With So Much Pain
All In His Voice
Its Sad But Its His Choice
Another Body Bagged Soon
Damn
Another Roll D
And Its Sad 
But The Youngster Couldn't Stop
Once He Learned It From The OG's
Another Victim Of The Cold Streets
I Thank God I'm Still Here
But Times I Shed A Tear
Its Dedicated To The Homies
Doing Time Up On The Tiers
Doing 25 To Life
Honestly Just Wasting Years
Sometimes I Get Letters From Inside
They Say They're Proud
Honestly I Just Thank God
That I'm Still Here
To Make Em Bounce
Chorus:
I Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bou-Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
I Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bou-Bounce, Rock, Roll, Skate
Bounce
Straight From The Golden State
And So They Hate
Bou-Bounce
Straight From The Golden State
And So They Hate
