This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic why don't you light it up
Now who's that kickin' in the K for the West?
Shade pop with the flows that seep hoes in your vest
Half nigga with the word, half run up in your spot to talk shit
Where I'm from, we prone to lick shots
Now Dogg Pound Gangsta's but me up on game
Now that I'm here a lot of shit gonna change
Mister quick to buy a chain, mister let the chain hang
Showin' off the broads I'm mister quick to get to bang
Now you might catch Sheist gettin' bent in every coast
Still the nigga with the heat gettin' rid of every coast
Still fuckin' with Mizz, we run trizz when we bored
And you know I got the X, twenties what they hittin' for
See me if you wanna score, 'cuz I got what you need
Or you can see me at the club, tinted SUV
Gettin' in for free, I'm 'bout to get my name known
Sheist pull a heist nigga just to get it on
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic why don't you light it up
Check this out
You see, how I figure this thing
We can, all take over this game
If we, come together do this shit right
We can, all have a piece of the pie
You know, how I figured this out
I just, took a little trip down South
Soon as, I set foot off the plane
It was, just like a family thing
You know, a gangsta's hard to deceive
So I, took a little trip to the East
I'm not, slow so I can wait for the game
I'm not, broke so I'm in bulletproof everything
When I, touch down it ain't like a thing
They ain't, trippin' off nothin' but things
So I, quickly disposed of my shades
If we, if we ain't got us nigga where would we aim
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic why don't you light it up
Yeah, show me somethin' I ain't never seen
I step in the house-party with a gangsta lean
It's Dogg Pound Gangsta's we strikin' back again
Ready to ride in the Lac again
Givin' it up for Mack 10 and T-Boz for doin' it
This ain't nothin' but a gangsta reunion
New York and California, the places to be
Nate Dogg and Kurupt broadcast for free
We at the Dogg House, where the dogs at
Who wanna get with me?
Baby meet me in the back
Young Damien Young, this is number two
Ridin' out room, nigga what you wanna do?
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic don't you light it up
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic don't you light it up
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic don't you light it up
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
