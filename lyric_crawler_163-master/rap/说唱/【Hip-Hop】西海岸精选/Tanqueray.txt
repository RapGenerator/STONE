Huh, now don't come to my party if you don't wanna get drunk 
It's me and my *******s and we puffin on a skunk 
Cus it's true when 
I'm bent and 
I'm ****** 
I can last long 
With some 
Gin and a grin cus my ****** grown 
Now don't trip ho, you like to get bent too 
Hit the thai, run, get ya coochie in bent too 
By a ******* that'll make ya sick 
You know me [scratch] [scratch] [scratch], 
Yeah Now let me tell you about a party that 
I threw last year 
*******s kept haulin that party over here 
Too many *******s so 
I had to get a keg of 
Budweiser 
But it had me pissin down my leg 
So I bought somethin that'll last longer 
Somethin a little harder somethin a little stronger 
Somethin that'll definitely make your day 
So what you say mutha*******a want some 
Tanqueray? 
Now the *******s up on it went got some orange juice 
Cus they know that 
Tanqueray'll get them hoes loose 
Fillin up your glass, boy you tryin to trip 
******* you can't handle full glass, fool take a sip 
But I'm not stingy so 
I filled it to the rim 
He went up in my kitchen with a ******* named 
Kim Straight bareback in the ******* he dove 
Huh, bustin nuts all on my stove 
From drinking that.. [Chorus] 
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin so fine 
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind 
So if you want to get bent in a big-o way 
Come on and drink a little 
Tanqueray [DJ Quik] 
Now the party started jumpin and the music got loud 
A hand full of *******s done turn into a crowd 
Out my control the party started hoppin 
And the more that *******s drunk, the more that started droppin 
*******t, my house got ****** up for certain 
With beer on my carpet, gum on my curtain 
*******s in my front yard bendin up the fence 
Havin a ****** great time all at my expense 
But I can't trip because 
I'm knowin 
*******s gon' be *******s and that's just the way *******t's goin 
But bout damn time 
I got a visit from the crew 
Playa Hamm and 
Shabby Bleu 
With some ******* hollin' (Hey, where the party at?) 
I said "The party's in my pants in ya monkey's kind a fat" "Naw I'm just bull*******ttin come on in" 
Now it was two bad *******, but they had an ugly friend 
Then the ho decided that she wanted to dance 
Spilled Boo 
Farm, all on my pants 
Plus she was spokin like a fingero ho 
But I didn't say a 
Goddamn thing cus 
I didn't know 
Then she and ?? started havin a fit 
Talking about (all y'all rappin *******s aint *******t) 
So I spit in her face and socked the ho in lip 
And dragged the ******* outta my tent 
Cus I was full of that.. [Chorus] 
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin so fine 
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind 
So if you want to get bent in a big-o way 
Come on and drink a little 
Tanqueray [DJ Quik] 
Check it, now the ******* straight skated, but then she rolled back 
Came up in the party wit a strap, *******ed it 
Jack, spotted it, hit her on the head and speed knotted it 
******* dropped the strap and 
I got it Rat pack time *******s, stop 
The lights came on and the ******* got dropped 
It was party over here and party over there 
Till the *******s trippin, and started pullin out her hair 
Now it really wouldn't nice to see 
When they beat a ******* down, and drag her ass out in the street "And you aint getting yo gat back showty" 
Put it in pocket went back to the pawty 
And everybody kicked it for the rest of the night 
Huh, bud straight facin and the vibe was right 
Wouldn't no mo' strappin everything was okay 
Each everybody up skated cus we was outta that.. [Chorus x2] 
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin so fine 
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind 
So if you want to get bent in a big-o way 
Come on and drink a little 
Tanqueray 
La la la la la la la la la...
