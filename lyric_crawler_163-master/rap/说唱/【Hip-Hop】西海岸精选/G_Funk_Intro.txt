[01:27.142]This is just a small introduction to the G-funk era
[01:28.854]Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
[01:31.334]And I see motherfuckers tryin' to be like me
[01:33.570]Ever since I put it down with the D-R-E
[01:36.703]
[01:37.156]Foamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail
[01:38.835]Searchin through the yard with a keen sense of smell
[01:41.100]Lookin' for the business in heat
[01:43.567]And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat
[01:46.689]We travel in packs and we do it from the back
[01:49.454]How else can you get to the booty?
[01:51.746]We do it doggystyle, all the while we do it doggystyle
[01:56.703]Yo motherfuckin' hoe!
[02:00.191]He fucked the fleas off a bitch
[02:02.740]He shaked the ticks off his dick
[02:04.393]And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone
[02:08.526]And if there's any left over
[02:11.895]He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home
[02:15.334]
[02:16.209]Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga
