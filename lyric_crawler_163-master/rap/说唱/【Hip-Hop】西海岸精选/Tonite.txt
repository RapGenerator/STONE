[00:22.01]I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
[00:24.12]Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
[00:27.08]So here's a toast to federal checks
[00:30.15]Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
[00:33.10]We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
[00:36.32]To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
[00:38.92]I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
[00:41.19]The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
[00:43.35]Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
[00:46.72]The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
[00:49.39]Then I buried the hatchet, I carried the fat chick
[00:51.79]Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
[00:54.58]Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two
[00:57.20]Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
[00:59.22]Back home when the party ends
[01:01.06]So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
[01:02.87]To the finest women in the audience
[01:04.74]Chorus:
[01:05.44]Women Singing:
[01:06.10]They honor the
[01:07.15]Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah (blends in with lyrics)
[01:07.45]Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
[01:08.66]We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
[01:09.71]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[01:10.57]Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
[01:13.18]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[01:14.13]We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
[01:15.34]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[01:17.51]Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
[01:19.76]Verse 2:
[01:25.81]Ayo, spiders are like tarantulas, vandealous
[01:28.26]Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
[01:30.87]But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
[01:35.71]Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
[01:36.81]I think a living never meant for me
[01:38.42]Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
[01:41.63]When I stumbled upon this resolution
[01:43.58]By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
[01:46.95]You couldn't see me with binoculars
[01:48.72]I armed like an octopus
[01:50.12]Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
[01:52.19]Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
[01:53.99]Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
[01:57.15]When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
[01:59.73]Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
[02:03.60]I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
[02:05.65]You got the point when I cleverly said it
[02:08.02]Chorus:
[02:08.47]Women Singing:
[02:09.32]Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah (blends in with lyrics)
[02:09.72]Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
[02:11.18]We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
[02:12.59]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[02:15.66]Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
[02:17.11]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[02:18.57]We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
[02:21.92]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[02:26.20]Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
[02:29.37]Verse 3:
[02:29.73]Eminem is heading skyward
[02:30.77]For those who thought that I would make you bored
[02:32.43]and treat you like a piece
[02:33.79]of plywood
[02:34.59]I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
[02:36.24]With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
[02:38.40]So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
[02:41.72]I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
[02:44.68]I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
[02:47.80]I'm hazardous enough already as it is
[02:49.65]Without you adding fuel to the fire
[02:51.31]I'm cruel to the liar
[02:52.77]Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
[02:54.77]Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
[02:57.28]There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
[02:59.60]I'm sure the party people can agree
[03:02.05]That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
[03:04.21]Freaking the vocals so frantically
[03:05.53]So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
[03:07.34]And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like
[03:10.50]Chorus:
[03:11.04]Women Singing:
[03:11.86]Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah (blends in with lyrics)
[03:12.25]Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
[03:13.01]We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
[03:15.17]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[03:17.82]Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
[03:21.23]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[03:22.95]We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
[03:26.61]Cause we came here to do this tonight
[03:29.26]Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
