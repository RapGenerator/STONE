A little bit of game is all it takes 
A little bit of game goes a long long way [Verse 1] 
Cuddie I don't sleep much, 'cause when 
I close my eyes 
I hear cries from my potna's who lost they lives 
Visions of bloody brutality's reality 
Gotta stay focused and hope it don't affect my salary 
Them calories, they keep my pockets fat, 
I got to stack a grip 
Try not to trip, and keep them gold diggers off my dick 
I'm gettin' sick 'cause 
I drink 24-7 
The way I'm livin' now, if 
I die, there's no heaven 
Gotta help my potnas in the pen 'cause they livin' broke 
This ain't no joke, on parole and 
I can't smoke 
No sticky indo, roll down the window '
Cause if I breathe[? ] the task is back [? ] like 
Nintendo Gotta play the game like a professional 
If you ain't having money 
I got to let you go 
I need to let you know the rules before you [? ] 
Rule number one potna, never should you pimpatrate 
I spit this pimpin' straight and cut no addatives 
Just nouns and adjectives, how mad you get don't mattter bitch 
I'm a player so 
I serve the game 
Maintain campaign, and have thangs [Chorus x2] [Verse 2] 
Back in '92 
I was drowned in them big cases 
But now it's '97 and 
I'm counting them big faces 
I switched places with them sardines and squares 
The [? ] fillet mignon, and garlic bread 
A hard head, big heart, and gorilla nuts 
Got me mobbin' thru the bay like 
I don't give a fuck 
I'm whipped, equipped, and stay dipped in butter sauce 
Pill if shes real, no scrill 
I cut her off '
Cause fine ass bitches with the empty bank book 
Is worse than them ugly muthafuckas who can't cook 
My game cooked for five years in the feds 
Now it's time for these game hungry niggas to get fed 
I get bread, so them suckas down me 
Smile in my face but clown me when they not around me 
Talk down on my every move, but 
I could'ntgive a damn 
Playas do what they want, and suckas do what they can [Chorus x2] [Verse 3] 7-5-70, my 
DOB, uhh And 
I've been breakin' hoes since '83, what? 
Money makers manual, handle my business discretly 
Don't give my home phone number out, beep me '
Cause ain't no tellin' who be tellin', or who they tell 
And plus I heard that they be sellin' kinfolk the yayo 
Boy get your mail, don't act like your lil sista 
If you lackin' in this mackin' boy 
I bet you fist her 
Get some get right as 
I come tight to this 
Doo Doo Dumb 
Track, that cat 
K-Lou, knew how to come 
With Mac Dre, that 3 
C veteran 
More game than 
March Madness, and dope as exederin 
Hit big licks, wouldn't pull no small capers 
I'm a be a dog and stay up like wall paper 
Look at these break bitches like they stank 
Collect my bank and stay sharp as a shank [Chorus]
