[01:43.12]And we'll never flip flop, always keep it hip hop
[01:45.36]A nigga dissin' on my bro, watch him fall like a drip drop
[01:48.40]From the faucet, show me the mic and watch me toss it
[01:50.94]And kick some derranged shit to make you think I've lost it
[01:52.86]Ah shit, I'm ready to rock I'm ready to roll and rock
[01:55.14]So give a nigga some room before I tick and I tock
[01:57.82]And explode like a bomb with the mic within my palm
[02:00.31]Won't you take a walk with me through the Compton Vietnam
[02:02.85]And let me show ya, fools much bolder
