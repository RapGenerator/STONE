[00:15]Brenda's got a baby
[00:25]Brenda's got a baby
[00:35]I hear brenda's got a baby
[00:38]Well, brenda's barely got a brain
[00:39]A damn shame
[00:41]Tha girl can hardly spell her name
[00:42]That's not her problem, that's up ta brenda's family
[00:45]Well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
[00:48]Now brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a junky
[00:51]Went in debt to his arms, it's sad
[00:54]Cause i bet brenda doesn't even know
[00:56]Just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
[00:59]But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
[01:02]Do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
[01:05]Brenda got herself a boyfriend
[01:07]Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
[01:10]She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
[01:13]Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
[01:16]Went out and had a church of kids
[01:19]As long as when tha check came they got first dibs
[01:22]Now brendas belly is gettin bigger
[01:25]But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
[01:27]She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
[01:30]In love with tha molester, who's sexing her crazy
[01:33]And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
[01:36]And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together, whatever
[01:40]He left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha bathroom floor
[01:43]And didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and what ta keep
[01:47]She wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
[01:50]I guess she thought she'd get away
[01:52]Wouldn't hear tha cries
[01:53]She didn't realize
[01:55]How much tha tha little baby had her eyes
[01:57]Now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
[01:59]Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
[02:02]Brenda wants ta run away
[02:04]Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, tha social workers here everyday
[02:08]Now brenda's gotta make her own way
[02:10]Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
[02:13]No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
[02:16]She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
[02:19]So now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell
[02:22]So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
[02:25]It's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain
[02:28]Prostitute, fair slang, and brenda's her name, she's got a baby
[02:32]Baaaaaaaaby
[02:40]Don't you know she's got a baby
[02:44]Don't you know she's got a baby
[02:46]Don't you know she's got a baby
[02:52]Don't you know she's got a baby
[02:55]Don't you know she's got a baby
[02:58]Don't you know she's got a baby
[03:02]
