[00:18.240]Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on.
[00:23.360]When I sit alone, come get a little known
[00:25.320]But I need more than myself this time.
[00:27.510]Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on
[00:32.350]When I lay it on, come get to play it on
[00:34.550]All my life to sacrifice.
[00:36.630]Hey oh... listen what I say oh
[00:44.880]I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh
[00:54.310]When will I know that I really can't go
[00:57.390]To the well once more - time to decide on.
[01:00.190]Well it's kiliing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside.
[01:04.750]Come to belive that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride,
[01:08.990]Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside.
[01:13.620]Hey oh... listen what I say oh
[01:22.330]Come back and hey oh
[01:25.700]look at what I say oh
[01:31.300]The more I see the less I know
[01:34.430]The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah...
[01:46.340]People need the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow,
[01:55.380]Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go;
[02:04.210]Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow,
[02:13.000]Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go
[02:21.020]Ho!
[02:32.000]Went to descend to ammend for a friend of the channels that had broken down.
[02:36.440]Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out.
[02:40.640]Step from the road to the sea to the sky,
[02:42.840]And I do belive what we rely on,
[02:45.630]When I lay it on, come get to play it on
[02:47.590]All my life to sacrifice
[02:49.710]Hey oh... Listen what I say oh
[02:58.630]I got your hey oh... listen what I say oh
[03:08.120]The more I see, the less I know
[03:10.440]The more I like to let it go - hey oh woah...
[03:22.390]People need the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow.
[03:31.340]Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go
[03:40.190]Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow
[03:49.270]Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go.
[03:58.020]I said hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now.
[04:07.210]Hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now.
[04:15.920]People need the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow,
[04:23.840]Finaly divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go.
[04:32.710]People need the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow...
[04:42.230]Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go.
