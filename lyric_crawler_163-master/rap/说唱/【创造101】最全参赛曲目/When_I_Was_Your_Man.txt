[00:13.200]Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
[00:20.060]Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
[00:26.660]When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down
[00:33.160]Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
[00:37.860]And it all just sound like uh, uh, uh
[00:46.550]Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize
[00:50.570]That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
[00:57.250]Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance
[01:03.840]Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
[01:10.540]Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.
[01:22.210]My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
[01:28.760]Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
[01:34.490]Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
[01:41.840]And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
[01:46.370]It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh
[01:55.190]Too young, too dumb to realize
[01:59.560]That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
[02:05.960]Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance
[02:12.550]Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
[02:19.330]Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.
[02:26.650]Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
[02:39.690]Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
[02:43.010]To try and apologize for my mistakes
[02:46.210]But I just want you to know
[02:51.910]I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
[02:59.170]Give you all his hours when he has the chance
[03:06.060]Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance
[03:12.590]Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!
[03:19.490]Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!
